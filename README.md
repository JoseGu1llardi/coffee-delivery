During this challenge, we used concepts a little more advanced developing from scratch an application ordering coffees! The application has 3 screens, the first one being a presentation screen and also a list of the coffees available. On the second screen, the user needs to fill out a form with their address data and on the right side you can view the items of the cart, being able to change the quantity or remove it. On the third and last screen, an order confirmation and also the delivery details of the purchase are displayed.
